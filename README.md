The goal of Artportalen_odonate_maps is to give access to ecological niche models (ENMs) of Swedish odonate species through maps and a R Shiny app. Both present-day and future models are available allowing local observers to target under-surveyed but potentially favorable areas.

Mostly climate variables have been used to build the ENM, not local availability of suitable habitats.
